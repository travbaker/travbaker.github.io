Hi! I'm Travis Baker. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow [in the group of Mile Gu](https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/milegu/) at the Quantum Complexity Institute, at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the theory group led by [Howard Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me/) at the Centre for Quantum Dynamics at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.
My appointment was as a researcher in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication technology, an Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence which develops cutting-edge quantum computing and communication technologies.
Under Howard's supervision, I was awarded my PhD in the same group in 2021.
