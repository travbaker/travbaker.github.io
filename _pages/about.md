Hi! My name is Travis Baker. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow [in the group of Mile Gu](https://www.quantumcomplexity.org/milegu/) at the Quantum Complexity Institute, within Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the theory group of Howard Wiseman at the Centre for Quantum Dynamics at Griffitgh University in Brisbane, Australia.
My appointment was as a researcher in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication technology, an Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence which develops cutting-edge quantum computing and communication technologies.
I received my PhD in the same group in 2021.
