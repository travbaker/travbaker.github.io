@article{Baker2021The-Heisenberg-,
	abstract = {Quantum optical coherence can be quantified only by accounting for both the particle- and wave-nature of light. For an ideal laser beam1--3, the coherence can be thought of roughly as the number of photons emitted consecutively into the beam with the same phase. This number, {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathfrak{\{}C{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, can be much larger than the number of photons in the laser itself, μ. The limit for an ideal laser was thought to be of order μ2 (refs. 4,5). Here, assuming only that a laser produces a beam with properties close to those of an ideal laser beam and that it has no external sources of coherence, we derive an upper bound on {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathfrak{\{}C{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}, which is of order μ4. Moreover, using the matrix product states method6, we find a model that achieves this scaling and show that it could, in principle, be realized using circuit quantum electrodynamics7. Thus, {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathfrak{\{}C{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}of order μ2 is only a standard quantum limit; the ultimate quantum limit---or Heisenberg limit---is quadratically better.},

@article{Tischler2018Conclusive-Expe,
	abstract = {Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a quantum phenomenon wherein one party influences, or steers, the state of a distant party's particle beyond what could be achieved with a separable state, by making measurements on one half of an entangled state. This type of quantum nonlocality stands out through its asymmetric setting, and even allows for cases where one party can steer the other, but where the reverse is not true. A series of experiments have demonstrated one-way steering in the past, but all were based on significant limiting assumptions. These consisted either of restrictions on the type of allowed measurements, or of assumptions about the quantum state at hand, by mapping to a specific family of states and analysing the ideal target state rather than the real experimental state. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of one-way steering free of such assumptions. We achieve this using a new sufficient condition for non-steerability, and, although not required by our analysis, using a novel source of extremely high-quality photonic Werner states.},

@article{Baker2018Necessary-condi,
	abstract = {Einstein{\^a}Podolsky{\^a}Rosen steering refers to the quantum phenomenon whereby the state of a system held by one party can be {\^a}steered{\^a} into different states at the will of another, distant, party by performing different local measurements. Although steering has been demonstrated in a number of experiments involving qubits, the question of which two-qubit states are steerable remains an open theoretical problem. Here, we derive a necessary condition for any two-qubit state to be steerable when the steering party suffers from a given probability of qubit loss. Our main result finds application in one-way steering demonstrations that rely upon loss. Specifically, we apply it to a recent experiment on one-way steering with projective measurements and POVMs, reported by Wollmann et al (2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 160403).},
